# zodiacAnimalsGame

This is a work in progress that will be continually updated as I see fit. It is an interactive game designed to teach the user the Chinese pronunciations of the animals of the Chinese zodiac. There is a learning function where the user clicks on an animal and the name of the animal is pronounced in English and Chinese, and a testing function where the user hears only the Chinese pronunciation and must guess the correct animal.
